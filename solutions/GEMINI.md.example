# Gemini CLI Mario Platformer

## Project Overview
A browser-based 2D Mario-style platformer game built as a tutorial for learning Gemini CLI. Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas. No external dependencies or build tools.

## Tech Stack
- Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no frameworks or build tools)
- HTML5 Canvas API for rendering
- Single file: index.html (all code in one file)

## Architecture
- Canvas: 800x500 pixels
- Game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Collision detection: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) via checkCollision()
- Code organized in sections with comment headers: // ======== SECTION ========
- Game objects are plain JavaScript objects (not classes)

## Key Objects
- `player` - x, y, width (32), height (32), velX, velY, speed, jumping, grounded
- `platforms` - array of {x, y, width, height, color} objects
- `keys` - object tracking pressed keys (ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Space, ArrowUp)
- `clouds` - decorative background elements

## Coding Style
- Use `const` for constants and objects, `let` for variables that change
- All game objects are plain objects (not classes)
- Colors as hex strings (e.g., '#e94560')
- Keep everything in a single index.html file
- Use descriptive section comments

## Canvas Coordinates
- Origin (0,0) is top-left corner
- X increases to the right (0 to 800)
- Y increases downward (0 to 500)
- Ground platform is at y=460

## Current State
- Player can jump (Space / ArrowUp) - WORKING
- Left/right movement - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- No collectibles, enemies, or score system yet
- player.velX, player.speed, FRICTION exist but are unused (intentional hooks)

## Important Notes
- The game must work by simply opening index.html in a browser (no server needed)
- Do not add external dependencies or separate JS/CSS files
- When adding features, follow the existing section comment pattern
